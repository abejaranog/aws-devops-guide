# Cloudformation

A CloudFormation template is deployed into the AWS environment as a stack. You can 
manage stacks through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line 
Interface, or AWS CloudFormation APIs. If you need to make changes to the running 
resources in a stack you update the stack. Before making changes to your resources, 
you can generate a change set, which is a summary of your proposed changes. Change 
sets enable you to see how your changes might impact your running resources, 
especially for critical resources, before implementing them
