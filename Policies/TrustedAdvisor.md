# Trusted Advisor
Trusted Advisor draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers. Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment, and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps.

If you have a Basic or Developer Support plan, you can use the Trusted Advisor console to access all checks in the Service Limits category and six checks in the Security category.

If you have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you can use the Trusted Advisor console and the AWS Support API to access all Trusted Advisor checks. You also can use Amazon CloudWatch Events to monitor the status of Trusted Advisor checks. For more information, see Monitoring AWS Trusted Advisor check results with Amazon EventBridge. 

## Automating Refreshes

When you visit the Trusted Advisor dashboard, any checks that have not been refreshed in the last 24 hours are automatically refreshed; this can take a few minutes. The date and time of the last refresh is displayed to the right of the check title.

In addtion, for customers with Business or Enterprise Support plans, the Trusted Advisor data is automatically refreshed weekly.
