# Inspector

Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, Amazon Inspector can be used across all accounts in your organization. Once started, Amazon Inspector automatically discovers running Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances and container images residing in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), at any scale, and immediately starts assessing them for known vulnerabilities.
