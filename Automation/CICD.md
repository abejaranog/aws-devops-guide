# CI/CD

## Continuous Integration

- Developers push the code to a code repository.
- A testing/Build server checks the code as soon as it's pushed (Codebuild, Jenkins CI)
- The developer gets feedback about the test and check if they have passed or failed
- Find bugs early, fix bugs
- Deliver faster as the code is tested
- Deploy often

## Continuous Delivery

- Ensure that the software can be released reliably whenever needed
- Ensure deployments happen often and are quick using automation.
- That usually means automated deployment or have a approve stage.

## Continuous deployment

Like continuous delivery but all automated. Code is deployed automatically to production.
